# Overview

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote and how it integrates with a Cloud Database. Describe how to use your program.}
This is essentially a bank account. You type in your login or sign up and it'll store that information into a cloud database. From there you can update your info by making a savings account and a checking account. As well as making goals that you can work towards through the budget planner. Which stores the goals and can later be shown when you display your account information.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of the cloud database.}
