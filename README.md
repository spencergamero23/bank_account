# Overview


This is essentially a bank account. You type in your login or sign up and it'll store that information into a cloud database. From there you can update your info by making a savings account and a checking account. As well as making goals that you can work towards through the budget planner. Which stores the goals and can later be shown when you display your account information.


I wrote this software because I thought it would be a fun project to take on. I have some experience with SQL but have never really tried mongoDB. Also I wanted a little program that could help me solve how much I should save a week for my future expenses.

# Cloud Database


- I'm using mongoDB which is a No SQL cloud database.


- The database I designed is used to store user account information for keeping track of their money as well as their goals.

# Development Environment


MongoDB to develop this software.


- I used python for this.
- I used the pymongo library as well as the datetime library

# Future Work
- Make it so that instead of putting in a new value for your checkings or savings you just put how much you're adding to it.
- For Check Account not showing id, username, and password.
- Maybe making it an actual software that has a ui?
